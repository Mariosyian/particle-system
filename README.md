# Particle System: Doggo Heaven

A mini project particle system created for COMP37111 - Advanced Computer Graphics.

The idea behind the particle system is to create a dog heaven filled with bouncy tennis balls.

This README file will be updated along the way with illustrations, 3D mockups and a demo video.
